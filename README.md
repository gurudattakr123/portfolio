### Work Experience
**AI Research Engineer @ Track Machines Connected GmBH (_March 2021 - Present_)**
- Developed Train Track Segmentation algorithm leveraging the SOA Semantic Segmentation model DeepLabV3+
- Implemented multi-sensor Calibration framework to calibrate 6 line scanners with a Lidar. This calibration process optimized sensor fusion, resulting in precise track geometry and reliable obstacle detection
- Developed an effective method of fusing the line scanner's Intensity data with range map at the image level. This technique yielded a remarkable 10x improvement in rail track mapping accuracy
